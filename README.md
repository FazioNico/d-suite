# d-workspace - Decentralized Cloud Solution 

> Censorship-resistant, tamper-proof and privacy compliant cloud solution, open-source, fully decentralized and built on top of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) 

## Project Description
d-workspace is a fully decentralized and open-source cloud solution which replace traditional cloud providers having centralized governance, cumbersome infrastructure, inadequate security and privacy measures with users datasets. 

d-workspace is build on top of IPFS and inherits all the features of Blockchain Technology to emerge as an immutable, censorship-resistant, tamper-proof and privacy complient with user dataset.

## Value Proposition
d-workspace integrat IPFS Core powered by Filecoin to enable users to store, manage and share their datas in a decentralized way. Few of the core value propositions are:

- Increased User Adoption: 
  Providing a smooth and intuitive process with seamless user experience to store, manage and share datas in a decentralized way will increase the adoption of IPFS and Filecoin.

- Real-world utility: 
  d-workspace provide a real-world utility for censorship-resistant, tamper-proof and privacy complient cloud solution by providing multi services composition that allow users to manage datas with total privacy and security controls of access by using Encryption and Decryption technologies to increase data acces security.

## Development

- Clone the d-workspace repository
- Install dependencies using NodeJS and NPM
- Install Nx Workspace CLI to manage workspace project
- Provide environment variables in `.env` file (see `Environment Variables` section)
- Run developpment server using `nx serve` command will open the d-workspace application in the browser
- This project was generated using [Nx Workspace](https://nx.dev).

## Build
- Run `nx build:browser` to build the d-workspace application for the browser as PWA. 

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment 

d-workspace is deployed automatically using Github Actions. Every commit to the `main` branch will trigger a new deployment.

## Documentation

- Run `npm run docs:browser` to generate the appplication documentation

The documentation will be generate in the `dist/` directory. Open the `dist/compodoc/browser/index.html` file in browser to see the documentation as website.

## Environment Variables
